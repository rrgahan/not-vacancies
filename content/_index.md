### About

The city labels it blight. Speculators call it a financial prospect. We see it as an opportunity to give the community what they want: empty lots turned into parks and gardens, burnt out homes restored to affordable housing, abandoned businesses turned into jobs.

### Sites

Any forsaken or neglected site in Lincoln qualifies. Vacant lot? Condemned house? Empty storefront? Send info to [@notvacancies](https://www.instagram.com/notvacancies) to get featured.

### Posters

Take your dreams. Write them down. Hang them up. Request posters [here](mailto:notvacancies@gmail.com?subject=Posters%20Please).
