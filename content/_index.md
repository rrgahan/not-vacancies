### About

The city labels it blight. Speculators call it a financial prospect. We see it as an opportunity to give the community what they want: empty lots turned into parks and gardens, burnt out homes restored to affordable housing, abandoned businesses turned into jobs. This art project encourages residents to call out the emptiness and dream of what could be.

### Sites

Any forsaken or neglected site in Lincoln qualifies. Vacant lot? Condemned house? Empty storefront? Send info to [@notvacancies](https://www.instagram.com/notvacancies) to get featured.

### Posters

Take your dreams. Write them down. Hang them up. Request posters [here](mailto:notvacancies@gmail.com?subject=Posters%20Please). Or, [download](NotVacancies-Posters.pdf) and print one yourself.
